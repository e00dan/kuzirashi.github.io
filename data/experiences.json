      "description": "Memsoria.pl is successful Open Tibia Server. For 3 years I've worked as the only web developer, programmer, linux administrator, graphic designer. I've created a lot of PHP systems for server website. It was created with Smarty and CodeIgniter, so I had to understand MVC and templating system. Server and website were hosted on Linux Debian machine so I gained a lot of experience with Linux. Also, both game server and website were using MySQL database so I've learned also much about SQL. During that time I also had to deal with securing website against SQL injections and other vulnerabilities. I've worked under pressure of time and quality of things I deliver had to be good because server had tens of thousands of accounts created. Server was also DDOSed so I gained some experience with Linux firewalls, network traffic, securing Linux machines. I understood there how to maintain and grow secure website starting from Linux + Apache, PHP + MVC up to HTML + CSS + JS/jQuery.",
